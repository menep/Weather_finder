A CSS and Javascript weather finder

Current stage:

==================== v01 ====================

Design and implementation of a weather app:

- The user can click on a button, to get get info about the weather at his location

- Once the button is clicked, the results (location, temperature, weather status, etc) are displayed in a div below the buttons

Responsive but not optimized for small screens (below 500px)
Only one JS file, structured upon a module pattern (data controller, ui controller, general controller)



----------- Further possible stages -----------

v02) Addition of a second button to choose the location

v03) Implementation of a button to see the forecast for the next few days

v04) Implementation of a map which shows the weather in the current area

v05) Setting the background to a photo that reflects the current weather status
