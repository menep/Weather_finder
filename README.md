A CSS and Javascript weather finder

Current stage:

==================== v01 ====================

Design and implementation of a weather app:

- The user can write in an input field their desired location
- "my location" returns weather results about their own location (obtained through geolocation api)
- The results are displayed below the title

Responsive but not optimized for small screens (below 500px)
Only one JS file, structured upon a module pattern (data controller, ui controller, general controller)



----------- Further possible stages -----------

v02) Implementation of a way to see the forecast for the next few days

v03) Implementation of a map which shows the weather in the current area

v04) Setting the background to a photo that reflects the current weather status
